SOBI
-----

A mobile app that aims to help a smoker,slowly reduce his consumption of tobacco and finally quit - taking slow steps and giving logical individual goals.
The app asks for the user's smoking habits as of now,how many cigarattes does he/she smoke a day and the average amount of money he spends daily.
With this data,the app provides a route map to help reduce his smoking habits slowly,with small goals daily,eventually leading him to be relieved of the habit.

Extra information such as the money he has saved,the no. of cigarettes he would've but hasn't smoked,weekly progression,lifetime restored is provided to help motivate the user to continue
his journey to what we like to call sobriety.
